# Co-Lab UI/UX Plan

## 1. Goal & Scope

Co-Lab is a research collaboration platform designed to help researchers work with AI to accelerate scientific breakthroughs, particularly in fields like nanotechnology and materials science. The platform aims to solve several key problems:

- **Knowledge Integration**: Connecting disparate research data and publications to identify new patterns and opportunities
- **Research Acceleration**: Leveraging AI to speed up analysis, ideation, and experimentation processes
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Enabling seamless collaboration between researchers and AI systems
- **Data Management**: Providing secure, organized storage and sharing of research assets
- **Incentivization**: Creating a token-based economy to reward valuable research contributions

The platform combines conversational AI interfaces with visualization tools, file management, task tracking, and tokenomics to create a comprehensive research environment.

## 2. Key Screens / Views

The Co-Lab application consists of two primary panels with multiple views within each:

### 2.1 Left Panel (Conversation Interface)

The left panel serves as the primary interaction point between researchers and the AI system. It consists of:

- **Conversation History Sidebar**: Displays previous research conversations for easy reference and continuation
- **Main Conversation Area**: The central workspace where researchers input prompts and receive AI responses
- **AI Control Interface**: Allows selection of AI models and operational modes

This panel is collapsible to maximize screen space when focusing on other aspects of the platform.

### 2.2 Right Panel (Functionality Tabs)

The right panel contains multiple tabbed sections that provide specialized functionality:

- **Tasks**: Manages research tasks and action items
- **Information Space**: Visualizes research connections and potential breakthrough opportunities
