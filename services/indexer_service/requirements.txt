# NOTE: This service also depends heavily on shared modules from the parent Co-Lab project
# (e.g., data_layer clients, core_ai.routing, config.settings). Ensure the execution
# environment makes these modules importable (e.g., running from the project root,
# using a monorepo tool, or packaging the shared modules).
