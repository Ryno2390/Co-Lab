# NOTE: This service also depends heavily on shared modules from the parent Co-Lab project
# (e.g., data_layer.indexer_client, config.settings). Ensure the execution environment
# makes these modules importable (e.g., running from the project root, using a
# monorepo tool, or packaging the shared modules).
